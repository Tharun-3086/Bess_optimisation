# Bess_optimisation
Naviagtion:
The provided zip file contains, certain files and research paper. Firstly, after extracting the zip file, open it in the MATLAB application, then select the "Main_BESS_Profit.m" file, and click run button at the top in  the application, then you will be able to see the results and a graph (returns vs BESS capacity).

Task:
The main goal of the paper is to find optimal BESS capacity by checkinbg revenue generated respectively for that capacity, and by finding out the best set of popualtion variables for the entire year, by applying GENETIC algorithm.
I've used some useful generation techniques like roulette-wheel selection(probabiltiy based selection), and mutation and crossover, which ensures best results.
